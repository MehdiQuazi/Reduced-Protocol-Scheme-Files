# Reduced-Protocol-Scheme-Files

These scheme files contain the MRI acquisition settings used to obtain the MRI data. The pathway for these files need to be defined in the MATLAB code containing the VERDICT model and the deep learning models. This code could not be shared due to permission and therefore can be requested from Dr. Matteo Figini/Dr. Marco Palombo.
